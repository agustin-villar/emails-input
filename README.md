# EmailsInput Library v.1.0.0
Provides an email address editor that allows to introduce multiple addresses at the same time, by typing or pasting them into the field. By default the library will add a new address when:

- The `,` key is pressed
- The `enter` key is pressed
- The `input` field is out of focus
- Text is pasted into the `input` field (If texts separated by `,` are pasted, the component will parse each one of them as a potential email address)

The component will also validate each email address at runtime by showing a visual indication of it. Email addresses can be removed by clicking on the cross button next to them.

A demo page with a working example can be checked [here](https://agustin-villar.github.io/emails-input-page/).

## Prerequisites
- There's no need of external dependencies to use this library.

## Usage
Add the script to the HTML document where it will be used:

```html
<script src="emails-input.1.0.0.js"><script>
```

> It's advised to add the script right before closing the `body` tag.

Once the script is loaded, a new `EmailsInput` object can be created by using the `new` keyword, and specifying the DOM Element that will contain the component:

```js
let inputContainer = document.querySelector('#input-container');
let myInput = new EmailsInput(inputContainer);
```

Additionally, an `options` object can be specified as a second parameter to override the default values for the input's placeholder and the remove button's label:

```js
let inputContainer = document.querySelector('#input-container');
let myInput = new EmailsInput(inputContainer, { placeholder: 'Type your email', removeLabel: 'delete' });
```

## Available methods

### addNewEmail(string):void
This method will take a string as an input and will add a new or multiple new 'email blocks' to the component. If the string is a list of addresses separated by commas, this method will try to create a new block for each one of the possible addresses.

```js
let myInput = new EmailsInput(inputContainer);

// a single address
myInput.addNewEmail('mail@example.com');

// multiple addresses
myInput.addNewEmail('mail@example.com,test@mail.com,user@gmail.com');
```

### getValidEmails(string):[string]|string
This function will check the email blocks rendered on the component and will filter out invalid email addresses. Then, it will return either an `array` or strings or a list of email addresses separated by `,` in `string` format. If the function parameter is anything differen than 'array', it will return the comma separated list.

```js
// By default will return an array of strings.
myInput.getValidEmails(); // ['mail@example.com', 'test@mail.com', 'user@gmail.com']

// If a parameter different than the string 'array' is specified, will return a string.
myInput.getValidEmails('string'); // 'mail@example.com,test@mail.com,user@gmail.com'
```

### getValidEmailsCount():number
Will return the amount of valid email addresses that are available in the component at a given moment.
```js
myInput.getValidEmails(); // 3
```

## Styling
This library provide basic styling for the main components. Styles can be easily overwritten if needed by targeting the element class selectors.

## How to run this project for development?
- Clone this repo.
- You will need, node `v12.18.0` (You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily change between node versions).
- Navigate to the project root on a terminal window.
- Run `npm install && npm start` if you are running it for the first time.
- You will be able to access the application under `http://localhost:8000`
- After the first time you can just run `npm start`.
- To generate a production build run `npm run build`.

## Known issues
Testing in IE11 has been complicated due to the lack of open source tools or reliable Virtual Machines, behaviour might be unexpected.
